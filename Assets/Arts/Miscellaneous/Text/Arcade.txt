**index** 1		//The surprising

Surprise !
Awesome, isn't it ?
I set up a whole new world only for you and some of my pals !
I did it while I was bored looking at you ...
Oh and just a little hint, if you want to skip the intro next time, just hold the shift key ;)
...
Wait, I hide my beautiful title ...
Better ?
And here ?
And now ?





**index** 2		//The entering

Just before you go, I have to tell you I improve your old gameplay a little just to make it more funney, don't mind it ...
And concerning my pals, do as if they were not there, except maybe the red ones ... Weird guys.
And now, come on in !!
(Choose with the arrows and then enter)





**index** 3		//The no-saving

Errrrrrrr, you know that this is the first time you discover this world and so you don't have any save ..?
Oh I get it ! You wanted to skip the boring beginning and get directly into the hard stuff !
Or you just try to mess my menu and make fun of me :)
...





**index** 4		//The no-saving 2

Ooooooh you're sooo silly :)
...





**index** 5		//The no-saving 3

Well you know, we'll do that !
You'll get what you want :)
HERE HE GOES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
...
Well, I haven't create this level yet, so please, just select "Reset" ...
...





**index** 6		//The no-saving 4

Pleeeeeeease ...





**index** 7		//The beginning

HERE WE GO !





**index** 8		//The come back

Surprise !
Well, not really a surprise, you already see this the last time, remember ?
I hope you'll do better this time ...
Ready to come in ?





**index** 9		//The no-saving come back

Errrrrrrr, You know you didn't save the last time either?
You really want to discover what would happen if you continue to hit "Continue" without save ..?
Or you just try to mess my menu and make fun of me :)
...






**index** 10		//Tuto : lazer

If I was you, I'll try to avoid this -Lazer- as much as I can ...
They will reduce your life little by little.
Just ... try to stay away from them ...
(They are pretty cool anyway)





**index** 11		//Tuto : saw

Yikes ! Watch out for these -Saw-, they could easily cut you in half ...
... or kill you painfully ...
:)




**index** 12		//Tuto : nuclear

Errrrr... well, stay calm, don't worry be happy, but I think you just activate some switch here ...
And this switch will soon start blinking ...
... more and more faster ...
You should better leave this face now.
I'm not sure about what will happen ...
Do as you want.




**index** 13		//Tuto : superlazer

I should have warned you sooner ...
But you see a huge Superlazer and step in without hesitation ...
Nobel Prize, really.




**index** 14		//Tuto : redrabbit

So, this is one of my red pals ! I think his name iiiiis ... whatever !
I dunno where he found that jetpack and his rocket launcher, but what a cool guy !
Beware the headshot.




**index** 15		//Some thought

...
Eh, I heard something funny lately recently :
If you put "violently" in front of anything to describe your action it becomes 1000x funnier !
"VIOLENTLY STUDIES"
"VIOLENTLY BREATHES"
"VIOLENTLY CLEANS HIS ROOM"
"VIOLENTLY READS A BOOK"
"VIOLENTLY PETS HIS DOG"
"VIOLENTLY MURDERS TEN CHILDREN"
Awesome, isn't it ?





**index** 16		//Some thought 2

...
You're terrible, y'know ?
I mean you really have absolutely NO talent for my gam- world !
And you always end up dying ...
Just sayin' ...





**index** 17		Some thought 3

...
In the dog world, humans are elves that routinely live to be 500+ years old.
...
"-They live so long ... but the good ones still bond with us for our entire lives."
"-These immortals are so kind, we must be good friends to them."
...
"-Now I am old. The fur around my muzzle is grey and my joints ache when we walk together..."
"...Yet she remains unchanged, her hair still glossy, her skin still fresh, her step still sprightly..."
"...Time doesn't touch her and yet I love her still."
...





**index** 18		Some thought 3 - suivant

...
"-For generations, he has guarded over my family. Since the days of my great-great-great-grandfather he has kept us safe..."
"...For so long we thought him immortal..."
"...But now I see differently, for just as my fur grows gray and my joints grow stiff, so too do his..."
"...He did not take in my children, but gave them away to his..."
"...I will be the last that he cares for..."
"...My only hope is that I am able to last until his final moments..."
"...The death of one of his kind is so rare. The ending of a life so long si such a tragedy..."
"...He has seen so much, he knows so much. I know he takes comfort in my presence..."
"...I only wish that I will be able to give him this confort until the end."
...





**index** 19		Some thought 4

...
Y'know, If I had to give a name to this world, I would call it "OUTERSNAKE" ...
Oh ! What a coincidence, it was the title you saw at the beginning !
Why "OUTERSNAKE" you ask ?
Well, y'know, you're in a 3D world now, you go from planet to planet ...
... planet, space, Outerspace, Snake ...
OUTERSNAKE !
Just so you know ...
...






**index** 20		Some thought 5

...
What is your idea of "the perfect date" ?
In my opinion, it's DD/MM/YYYY, other formats are just barbaric !
...





**index** 21		Some thought 6

...
According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because the bee doesn't care what humans think is impossible.
...





**index** 22		Some thought 7

...
Don't you think all my friends look alike ..?
They all behave the same and don't have so much conversation ...
They look like dumb clones unable to communicate ...
I dunno.
...





**index** 23		Tuto : rabbit

Wait, did you just killed one of my friends ??
Yeah, I am aware to the fact that it looks funny (and that they add +10 to your length ...)
But I mean, they're living beings just like you and me ...
And also a precious frien- I mean they all are precious friends of mine !
So just enjoy apples.
And you do not know what they are able to do ...
Crazy guy.





**index** 24		Tuto : tree

...
A tree.
You just ran into a tree.
A basic tree.
Well done.
(I like the way the leaves fall by the way)





**index** 25		Tuto : no continue after nuclear

It seems that nuclear bomb was a little too powerful and blows up our entire world ...
I think you have to choose "Reset" ...
Be careful next time.





**index** 26		The reboot

(nothing happened)




**index** 27		Tuto : rotten apple

Yuuuck! this apple was not very fresh ...
In fact I think it was probably a poop of rabbit.
Each his own !




**index** 28		Tuto : rocket

Warning : this device isn't completely reliable.
Yet you have to take it if you want to discover new world :)
And I increase the difficulty every time you take the rocket :) :)
Good luck ! :> :> :>




**index** 29	Tuto : nuclear 2

Have you just exploded one of the faces of my planet ??
It takes me times to do it !
Don't you dare do it again !




**index** 30		Tuto : casterblaster

These Casterblaster are pretty cool, aren't they ??
Hu, do they seem familiar to you ?
Because I was slightly inspired by another ga- world for them.
Do not let them turn you around !!




**index** 31		Tuto : hole

Oops, I maybe forgot to warn you about the hole ...
In fact you can't go in there, because of, y'know, the radiation of the core, all that stuff ...
Don't you dare find a way to go in there !




**index** 32		Tuto : meteore

Caution : possible falls of meteor in the area.
They don't make so much damage anymay ...
Have fun.




**index** 33		//The no-saving 5

Just kidding.





**index** 34		//The Death with Save

...
Seems like you just died ! Pretty lame ...
Well, as I knew you weren't very skilled, I manage to keep some spare souls in case.
Here you have 10 souls that you're free to use as you want !
Well not really as you want, it's Liveley, a friend of mine, who keeps them.
So you just have to deal with him to foul the Death !
Don't worry, he doesn't ask a lot in exchange, you'll see that later ...
OR !
As you've already saved your existence in this world at Looney's, you could also come back see her !
It'll cost you nothing.
So as you want.

Errrr ... you could have gone back to see Looney if you'd saved earlier ...
But you didn't saved yet.
So I guess you'll choose the Liveley option.





**index** 36		//The Looney's place

Hey ! You go at Looney's !
We're not in very good terms ...
But she's cool anyway !
She'll allow you to save your existence in this world !
And also do not forget to try the milk honey ...
