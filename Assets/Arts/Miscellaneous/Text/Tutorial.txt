**index** 1		//The beginning

* Astounding!
* I think this third dimension suits you perfectly!
* Let's beginning!\n* I'll check whether you're able to <color=red>survive by your own or not.
* Alright then...\n* You already know the Apples: they add <color=yellow>+1 to your beautiful body!
* Lazers right there will <color=red>SHOOT you and reduce your life little by little, avoid them!
* These Saws could easily cut you in half or <color=red>KILL you instantly, watch out!
* And as our first play together, I settle this <color=yellow>RACE just for you...
* READY?\n* STEADY?
* 1...\n* 2...\n* 3...
* GO!


**index** 2		//The finish 1

* Impressive!\n* Without a scratch!
* And in time on top of that!\n* You sure are a smart one, aren't you??
* Now you'll get yourself in that rocket and discover your first PLANET!
* <color=yellow>Looney's there unless she isn't, you'll see.
* There're already some pals, say hello, don't be shy!


**index** 3		//The finish 2

* Impressive!\n* Without a scratch!
* You found a way to end this race in a trice but you manage to fail anyway...\n* Whatever!
* Now you'll get yourself in that rocket and discover your first PLANET!
* <color=yellow>Looney's there unless she isn't, you'll see.
* There're already some pals, say hello, don't be shy!


**index** 4		//The finish 3

* Impressive!\n* Without a scratch!
* Speed isn't one of your strong point but who cares?
* Now you'll get yourself in that rocket and discover your first PLANET!
* <color=yellow>Looney's there unless she isn't, you'll see.
* There're already some pals, say hello, don't be shy!


**index** 5		//The Death

* ...
* Seems like you just died!\n* Pretty lame...
* Well, as I knew you weren't very skilled, I manage to keep some spare <color=yellow>souls in case.
* Here you have 10 souls that you're free to use as you want!
* Well not really as you want, it's <color=yellow>Liveley, a friend of mine, who keeps them.
* So you just have to deal with him to foul the <color=red>Death!
* Don't worry, he doesn't ask a lot in exchange, you'll see that later...
* OR!
* As you've already saved your existence in this world at <color=yellow>Looney's, you could also come back see her!
* It'll cost you nothing.
* As you want.


**index** 6		//The Death without Save

* ...
* Seems like you just died!\n* Pretty lame...
* Well, as I knew you weren't very skilled, I manage to keep some spare <color=yellow>souls in case.
* Here you have 10 souls that you're free to use as you want!
* Well not really as you want, it's <color=yellow>Liveley, a friend of mine, who keeps them.
* So you just have to deal with him to foul the <color=red>Death!
* Don't worry, he doesn't ask a lot in exchange, you'll see that later...
* OR!
* Errrr... you could have gone back to see <color=yellow>Looney if you'd saved earlier...
* But you didn't.
* So I guess you'll choose <color=yellow>Liveley.


**index** 7		//The New Playground

* Welcome to your new playground!\n* Make yourself like home!
* Those <color=yellow>WHITE <color=yellow>AND <color=yellow>YELLOW <color=yellow>RABBIT seem like they want to play.\n* Go and catch them!
* Have fun.


**index** 8		//The One White And Yellow

* WAAAAAAAAAAIT!
You've already eaten %d of my friends!


**index** 9		//The One White And Yellow (suite A)

Apples aren't good enough anymore?
I'm aware rabbits add at least <color=orange>+5 to your length but...
We're also living people.
However I'm ready to forgive all that bloody and cold-hearted slaughtering if...
You listen to me...


**index** 10		//The One White And Yellow (suite B)

...
So you've just killed my brothers... How kind of you.
Rabbits add at least <color=orange>+5 to your length when you eat them...
But you did not, thank god!
However I'm ready to forgive the tragic loss of my family if you listen to me...


**index** 11		//The One White And Yellow (suite C)

Ooooooh...
So you've eaten nobody, get bored and came for a nice chat!
Rabbits add at least <color=orange>+5 to your length when you eat them...
But you didn't eat anyone, thanks!
So I feel like I have something to say...


**index** 12		//QUESTION: The listening to him

Will you listen to me?
Sure!
Nope.


**index** 13		//Sure! (murderer)

Thank you.
As you have already been able to judge, some rabbits are different from others.
You guessed it by seeing my muscular right arm...
I am the world champion of one-handed rubik's cube! Heavyweight category!
Hu, you ask why we need caterogy in a rubik's cube competition?
Well, otherwise you could end up hurt obviously!
Anyway, my former brothers and I are the caretakers of that place.
We came here to reactivate that teleporter. Someone had taken it away...
You could take it and get out of here!
Soooo... In addition of my terrifying body...
I am a man of culture as well! Unlike those <color=orange>YELLOW <color=orange>RABBIT.
Some rabbits might just want to have a nice chat and thus make your stay here more enjoyable!
... And when a rabbit has finished talking, life resumes its course...
It'll be awkward if they had to repeat everything they said.
So if you come back to him, I doubt something different than them being eaten by you happens.
You're warned now.

Alright.
As you have already been able to judge, some rabbits are different from others.
You guessed it by seeing my muscular right arm...
I am the world champion of one-handed rubik's cube! Featherweight category!
Hu, you ask why we need caterogy in a rubik's cube competition?
Well, otherwise someone could end up hurt obviously!
Anyway, my beloved brothers and I are the caretakers of that place.
We came here to reactivate that teleporter. Someone had taken it away...
You could take it and come visit me later!
Soooo... In addition of my gorgeous body...
I am a man of culture as well! Unlike those <color=orange>YELLOW <color=orange>RABBIT.

**index** 15		//Nope. (murderer)

Alrighty sweetheart.
I do not think I can forgive you like that...
Take this teleporter so you can get out of here.
By the way I do <color=red>NOT like to repeat myself.
So if you come back to me, I doubt something different than me being eaten by you happens.
Bye now.
(Use the arrow keys to end a conversation.)


**index** 16		//Nope. (future murderer?)

Alrighty.
I am watching you.
Take this teleporter so you can get out of here.
By the way I do <color=red>NOT like to repeat myself.
So if you come back to me, I doubt something different than me being eaten by you happens.
Have a nice day!
(Use the arrow keys to end a conversation.)


**index** 17		//Repetition

* What did I just say??


**index** 18		//Repetition 2

* I won't repeat it!


**index** 19		//Repetition 3

* I won't...\n* Alright then...
