**index** 1		//Welcome Hell !

I think you're right.
Someone as talented as you shouldn't waste his time listening to some random tuto.
Or playing dumbly with a difficulty level of 1.
I just set it on 665.5 ...
Just for you.
Have fun <3

You really thought you could pause here ??
No pause for real men ! *contracts its muscles manfully*




**index** 3		//The escaping

I was thinking ...
Are you aware of the fact that I didn't have made a way to escape this hell ?
In fact, it is possible, but you have to find a bug in your gameplay ...
The very first glitch I encounter during the creation of this world.
And as I was unable to correct it properly, I merely reboot the game when it occurs !
Yet I dunno what happen during the rebooting ...
Nevermind, I added a way to escape, maybe you have to survive a certain time, or make all the nuclear explode, I dunno ...
Let me know when you want to come back to the main game.
I have to go.
